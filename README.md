Queue Implementation using Singly Linked List

This C program implements a queue data structure using a singly linked list. Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle,= where the first element added is the first to be removed.

Key Features:

Insertion (Enqueue): Adds an element to the rear of the queue.<br>
Deletion (Dequeue): Removes the front element from the queue.<br>
Display: Prints the elements of the queue in the order from front to rear.<br>
Queue Overflow/Underflow Handling: Prevents the queue from exceeding its maximum size or becoming empty.<br>

Input:

The program will prompt you to enter the maximum size of the queue.
You'll then be presented with a menu to choose from the following operations:<br>
1: Enqueue an element to the queue<br>
2: Dequeue an element from the queue<br>
3: Display the queue<br>

Output:

The program will display appropriate messages for queue overflow, underflow, and successful operations.<br>
It will also print the elements of the queue when you choose to display them.
